          After developing major dashboards in the finance industry for several years, the urge to switch contexts and dive further into tech grew too strong to ignore.

        <div className='about-me-text'>
          My passion for developing is unmatched. Every day I wake up pumped to collaborate, design and code. I love every aspect of bringing an idea to fruition and find each step of the way exciting.
